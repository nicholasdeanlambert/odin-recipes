# odin-recipes

This is a directed project assigned by Odin Project that I'm using to brush up on my HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills.

There are many like it but this one is mine.

This site contains a short list of recipes.

It is not a pretty site. But it is functional. Form should follow function. Function should always come first.
