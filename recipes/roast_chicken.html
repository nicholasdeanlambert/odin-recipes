    <h2>Roasting chicken and potatoes in the oven is a classic Greek meal.</h2>
    <p>
      Honey mustard is also used in many Greek recipes. Here, two classics
      combine for a delicious one-pan dinner. The potatoes are
      melt-in-your-mouth and the honey mustard sauce that magically develops in
      the pan is so good you may want to drink it!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup freshly squeezed orange juice</li>
      <li>1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>1/4 cup yellow mustard</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>5 large yellow or gold potatoes, peeled (about 2 1/2 pounds)</li>
      <li>4 pounds skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs</li>
      <li>additional honey for serving (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees
        C).
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the orange juice, olive oil,
        mustard, honey, salt, oregano, and black pepper. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut each peeled potato into randomly-shaped pieces about 1 to 1 1/2
        inches in size.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place potatoes in the bowl with orange juice mixture, toss to coat, then
        scoop into a large roasting pan. Spread out evenly in a single layer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place chicken thighs in the mixing bowl and coat with remaining orange
        juice mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer to the roasting pan, setting on top of the potatoes. Pour over
        any remaining juice mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are tender and chicken has
        reached an internal temperature of 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 1 to 1
        1/2 hours. Check halfway through roasting and add hot water to the pan
        only if the potatoes are drying out; at the end of roasting there should
        be only juices in the pan, not too much excess water, so add only as
        needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve with additional honey drizzled over the top of the chicken and
        potatoes, if desired.
      </li>
    </ol>
